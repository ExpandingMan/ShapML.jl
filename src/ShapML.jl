Compute stochastic feature-level Shapley values for any ML model.

# Arguments
- `explain::DataFrame`: A DataFrame of model features with 1 or more instances to be explained using Shapley values.
- `reference`: Optional. A DataFrame with the same format as `explain` which serves as a reference group against which the Shapley value deviations from `explain` are compared (i.e., the model intercept).
- `model`: A trained ML model that is passed into `predict_function`.
- `predict_function`: A wrapper function that takes 2 required positional arguments–(1) the trained model from `model` and (2) a DataFrame of instances with the same format as `explain`. The function should return a 1-column DataFrame of model predictions; the column name does not matter.
- `target_features`: Optional. An `Array{String, 1}` of model features that is a subset of feature names in `explain` for which Shapley values will be computed. For high-dimensional models, selecting a subset of features may dramatically speed up computation time. The default behavior is to return Shapley values for all instances and features in `explain`.
- `sample_size::Integer`: The number of Monte Carlo samples used to compute the stochastic Shapley values for each feature.
- `parallel::Union{Symbol, Nothing}`: One of [:none, :samples, :features, :both]. Whether to perform the calculation serially (:none) or in parallel over Monte Carlo samples (:samples) with `pmap()` and/or multi-threaded over target features (:features) with @threads or :both.
- `seed::Integer`: A number passed to `Random.seed!()` to get reproducible results.
- `precision::Union{Integer, Nothing}`: The number of digits to `round()` results in the ouput (to reduce the size of the returned DataFrame).
- `chunk::Bool`: Default `true`. Increases speed on data with many instances and/or features. Calls the `predict()` function once per sample in `sample_size` instead of once per call to `ShapML.shap()`.
- `reconcile_instance`: EXPERIMENTAL. For each instance in `explain`, the stochastic feature-level Shapley values are adjusted so that their sum equals the model prediction. The adjustments are based on feature-level sampling variances and are typically small compared to the model prediction.

# Return
- A `size(explain, 1)` * `length(target_features)` row by 6 column DataFrame.
    + `index`: An instance in `explain`.
    + `feature_name`: Model feature.
    + `feature_value`: Feature value.
    + `shap_effect`: The average Shapley value across Monte Carlo samples.
    + `shap_effect_sd`: The standard deviation of Shapley values across Monte Carlo samples.
    + `intercept`: The average model prediction from `explain` or `reference`.
